An open-source high-level synthesis book

# Background

Parallel Programming for FPGAs is an open-source book aimed at teaching hardware and software developers how to efficiently program FPGAs using high-level synthesis (HLS). The authors developed the book as we noticed a lack of material aimed at teaching people to effectively use HLS tools.

The book was developed over many years to serve as a primary reference for [UCSD 237C](http://kastner.ucsd.edu/ryan/cse237c/) — a hardware design class targeting first-year graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. We hope that you find it useful for learning more about HLS, FPGAs, and system-on-chip design.
